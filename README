== SAIL Data Service

SAIL is the Scalable Architecture for Interactive Learning, http://www.telscenter.org/confluence/display/SAIL. 

The SAIL Data Service implements web services which allow portals to deploy SAIL-based Java learning environments.

The SDS supports dynamically creating jnlp files for starting SAIL-based Java webstart applications delivered to 
workgroups of students. The data the workgroup has previously created are delivered and any new data the workgroup
creates during their session using the application are saved back to the SDS.

The SDS is designed to be used in combination with an existing portal. The portal works with the SDS to 
make SAIL activities available for it's users. The users normally never see the SDS.

Projects are made available to cohorts of users/learners through 'Offerings'. One Project can be 
made available through many Offerings -- each Offering is for a different cohort of users.

The SDS needs two things in order to create an Offering a Curnit (a SAIL curriculum unit) and an 
existing Jnlp for the SDS to use as a template. The template Jnlp lists all the Java resources needed 
to run the Curnit. In the TELS project this is a jnlp that is created by the programmers running a script 
after they have checked in and built new revisions of the Java application.

After a curnit and jnlp are associated in an Offering, SAIL users are registered in the SDS by the portal. 
This is normally not done directly on the SDS (though it can be when testing), instead an existing portal 
registers its users on the SDS by calling REST-based web services in the SDS.

After SailUsers and an Offering are created, Workgroups for that Offering are created consisting of one 
or more SDS SailUsers. At this point a Jnlp url becomes available for starting an SDS Offering for that 
Workgroup.

The normal course at this point is for the portal to make the Jnlp url available to authenticated members 
of the workgroup. Any data created by the users during their session with the Offering will be saved to 
the SDS and made available the next time they run the same Offering. These data are also available for 
reporting to teachers and researchers.</p>
