== 0.3.5.1 - 8-Feb-2007
* Fixed a bug reported by Kirk Haines where string-inputs were sliced into
  oblivion by Worksheet#write. This only concerns gem-installations of
  Spreadsheet::Excel. Stupid, stupid maintainers should create gems from a
  clean export, not a working directory containing highly experimental code!

== 0.3.5 - 18-Aug-2006
* Instead of making OLEWriter inherit from IO, just have it delegate
  the IO method calls to an IO object reference in an instance variable. That
  way the developer can specify an IO or IO-like object to which OLEWriter will
  write. This allows developers to use StringIO objects (or any IO-like object).
  Thanks go to Daniel Amelang for the feature request, the patch, and most of
  this description.
* Implemented a Feature Request by Randal Santia: it is now possible to specify 
  alignment and border as additional values in the configuration-hash passed to 
  Format.new as if alignment= or border= were called.

== 0.3.4 - 17-Feb-2006
* Added a workaround for a bug in Ruby 1.8.3 and Ruby 1.8.4 where subclasses
  of IO are not guaranteed to call IO#close in block form.
* Added support for hidden and outlined cells in the Worksheet#format_row
  method.  Thanks go to Jade Meskill for the patch.

== 0.3.3 - 5-Dec-2005
* Made an change in the Workbook class, by splitting out the OLEWriter
  handling into its own method.  This is an internal change only that was
  made as an attempt to eliminate an Errno::EBADF bug reported by
  Stephen Bannasch.  It's also cleaner code in general.

== 0.3.2 - 12-Oct-2005
* Fixed bug/quirk for MS Windows where the file mode wasn't being passed
  properly.
* Fix for the install.rb code.
* Renamed "example_formula.rb" to "example_format.rb" (oops).
* Minor update for the example programs.
* Corrected the release dates for 0.3.0 and 0.3.1.

== 0.3.1 - 11-Oct-2005
* Directory layout change for the sake of gems.
* Fixes, and rename, for the gemspec.

== 0.3.0 - 10-Oct-2005
* The OLEWriter class is now a subclass of IO instead of File, and takes a
  string, fileno or IO object for an argument.  This means you are not bound
  to write the contents to a file (RFE #1183036).
* Bug fixed in the Format class that was causing black cells (Bug #1044052).
* Removed the INSTALL file.  Installation instructions can now be found in
  the README file.
* Removed the InvalidTypeError class. Now just uses TypeError where
  appropriate.
* Added the Worksheet#format_rectangle method (RFE #1043418).
* Removed the .rd and .html documents.  The .txt files, and most other
  files, are now rdoc friendly.
* Moved sample scripts to the 'examples' directory.
* Test suite additions and changes.

== 0.2.9 - 11-Jun-2004
* Added 'brown','cyan' and 'magenta' to the list of valid color strings
  for Format objects.
* Fixed bugs and slightly modified handling with regards to color,
  bg_color and fg_color attributes for Format objects.  Thanks go to
  David Brady for the spot.
* Minor optimization for the append and prepend methods in the BiffWriter
  class
* Minor $LOAD_PATH correction for test.rb
* Added some more unit tests for Format ojbects.
* Added warranty information

== 0.2.8 - 2-Dec-2003
* Eliminated warnings for 1.8.x
* Added a README file (which you should, of course, read)
* Tidied up test suite a bit, and made it MS Windows-friendly.
* Separated rd docs from source.  They are now in the 'doc' directory.  In
  the future, I plan to use RDoc for this package.
* Eliminated warnings caused by worksheet.rb when $DEBUG mode was used
  (method redefinitions).
* Renamed test cases to "tc_" for (foolish?) consistency with my other
  packages.
* Removed the VERSION() class method - use the constant instead.

== 0.2.7 - 18-May-2003
* Modified worksheet.rb to truncate strings over 255 characters instead of
  raising a MaxSizeError.  This is what it should have been doing.  Thanks
  go to an anonymous sourceforge user.
* Minor modifications to test.rb and the MANIFEST

== 0.2.6 - 7-Apr-2003
* Fixed minor bug in the write_blank() method which was accidentally
  reintroduced.
* The write_row() and write_column() methods now handle nil properly
* Fixed a bug in the write_url() method.
* Yet more unit tests added.
* Minor doc tweaks/corrections.
* Removed annoying MS Windows line formatting.

== 0.2.5 - 8-Mar-2003
* Added the format_row() and format_column() methods to worksheet.rb.
  These are analogous to the set_row() and set_column() methods.
* Updated the test suite for testunit 0.1.8
* Fixed some bugs in the test suite
* Updated and fixed some documentation

== 0.2.4 - 30-Jan-2003
* Fixed a bug in the write_blank method.  Thanks to moumar for the spot
  and the patch.

== 0.2.3 - 15-Jan-2003
* Added the write_row and write_column methods
* Some optimization

== 0.2.2 - 20-Dec-2002
* Fixed variable name typo's in worksheet.rb and format.rb. Thanks
  go to Mark Slagell for the spot.
* Modified the tarball directory layout a bit - nothing special
* Added a copyright notice
* Added a VERSION method to the Excel class (class method)
* Some documentation corrections

== 0.2.1 - 11-Dec-2002
* Fixed a bug with num_format property in Format class
* Added lots of documentation for Format class, mostly lifted
  from John McNamara's documentation
* Added block-style constructors for Format class
* Added ability to pass Format instances to the add_format Workbook
  method

== 0.2.0 - 3-Dec-2002
* Added formats!
* Minor fix in worksheet.rb
* Added verbose output for install.rb
* A few more tests

== 0.1.1 - 29-Nov-2002
* Tarball fix
* install.rb fix

== 0.1.0 - 27-Nov-2002
* Initial Release
* Based on version .21 of Spreadsheet::WriteExcel (by John McNamara)
* Well, technically, I did release version .11 of Spreadsheet::WriteExcel
  on the web, but this is the first *official* release
